#COURSE PLANNER


## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
Course Planner is to be a website that will enable students to efficiently and easily schedule reminders for all of their coursework. Using information collected from your peers, through a comprehensive course element rating system, as well as custom settings collected from the user, a scheduling system will generate helpful reminders directing you when to begin studying or working on certain assignments. Course Planner is unique to other existing scheduling applications in that it automatically creates and schedules reminders using both userâ€™s preferences and information sourced from other students to allow easier study scheduling.
